Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

- Use TypeScript for all new code.
- Follow the existing code style and conventions.
- Write clear and concise comments.
- Ensure all new features are covered by tests.
- Keep security in mind and validate all user inputs.
- Use the provided utility functions for common tasks (e.g., date formatting, database operations).
- When creating test scripts or utility scripts, place them in a `scripts/` folder instead of the project root.
- **Use pnpm as the preferred package manager** whenever possible for consistency and performance:
  - Use `pnpm install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn install`
  - Use `pnpm add [package]` for adding dependencies
  - Use `pnpm remove [package]` for removing dependencies
  - Use `pnpm run [script]` for running package scripts
- **Always kill the development port before starting the app** to avoid port conflicts:
  - Before running `pnpm run dev`, first kill any existing processes on port 3001: `lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9`
  - Then start the development server: `pnpm run dev`
  - Full command sequence: `lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9 && pnpm run dev`
- **Use shadcn-ui components as much as possible** for UI consistency and best practices:
  - Prefer shadcn-ui components over custom implementations when available
  - Install new shadcn-ui components using `bunx shadcn@latest add [component-name]`
  - Follow shadcn-ui patterns for component composition and styling
  - Leverage existing components like Button, Dialog, Alert Dialog, Input, Select, etc.
  - Reference shadcn-ui documentation at https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components for implementation examples
  - Maintain consistent design patterns across the application using shadcn-ui primitives
- **Project Cleanup Routine** - Always perform after successful completion of features and user confirmation:
  - Remove outdated duplicate files (e.g., page-old.tsx, page-new.tsx, backup files)
  - Clean up temporary test files from project root and scripts folder (*.test.js, test-*.js, test-*.csv, etc.)
  - Remove unused imports and dead code
  - Consolidate similar components or utilities
  - Move any remaining test/utility scripts to the `scripts/` folder
  - Verify all file paths and imports are still valid after cleanup
  - Run `pnpm run build` to ensure the project still builds successfully after cleanup
  - Confirm cleanup completion with the user before considering the task finished
