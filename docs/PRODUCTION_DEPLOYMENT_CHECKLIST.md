# Production Deployment Checklist - Budget Period Fix

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Production database migrated (columns added)
- ‚úÖ October period dates set correctly
- ‚úÖ September historical data created
- ‚ùå Code not deployed to production yet

## Issue
The production website is still running the OLD code that doesn't use the new `current_period_start` and `current_period_end` fields. That's why it's showing September data - it's calculating from the original `startDate` instead of the current period.

## What Needs to be Deployed

### Files Modified for Budget Period Feature:
1. ‚úÖ `src/db/schema.ts` - Added budget period fields
2. ‚úÖ `src/lib/db-utils.ts` - Added period calculation functions
3. ‚úÖ `src/app/(dashboard)/budgets/page.tsx` - Updated to use current period dates
4. ‚úÖ `src/app/api/budgets/route.ts` - Accepts new fields
5. ‚úÖ `src/app/api/cron/budget-reset/route.ts` - Auto-reset endpoint
6. ‚úÖ `src/app/api/budgets/[id]/periods/route.ts` - Period API
7. ‚úÖ `vercel.json` - Cron configuration

### Environment Variables Needed in Vercel:
- ‚úÖ `CRON_SECRET` - Already set in .env.local: `d642236e6962de54b2b8cb558f8bf2a10fd2b2b5bd5a1046731db9ae3c1e3616`

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Verify Local Changes Work
```bash
# Start local dev server
pnpm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3001/budgets
# Verify:
# - Current Month shows October 2025 data
# - Spending is calculated for October only (should be low/zero)
# - Days left shows ~30 days
```

### 2. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Add all modified files
git add src/db/schema.ts \
        src/lib/db-utils.ts \
        src/app/\(dashboard\)/budgets/page.tsx \
        src/app/api/budgets/route.ts \
        src/app/api/cron/budget-reset/route.ts \
        src/app/api/budgets/\[id\]/periods/route.ts \
        src/components/budget-period-display.tsx \
        vercel.json \
        docs/*.md

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: implement budget period tracking and auto-reset

- Add budget_periods table for historical tracking
- Add auto-reset and rollover functionality
- Fix budget calculation to use current period dates
- Add Vercel Cron job for automatic monthly resets
- Create September 2025 historical data
- Update UI to show correct October 2025 period"

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

### 3. Configure Vercel Environment Variable
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `tracker-expenses`
3. Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Add new variable:
   - **Key**: `CRON_SECRET`
   - **Value**: `d642236e6962de54b2b8cb558f8bf2a10fd2b2b5bd5a1046731db9ae3c1e3616`
   - **Environment**: Production
5. Click "Save"

### 4. Trigger Deployment
Vercel will automatically deploy when you push to main. Monitor at:
https://vercel.com/[your-account]/tracker-expenses/deployments

### 5. Verify Production After Deployment
1. Visit https://tracker-expenses.avilacode.tech/budgets
2. Check "Current Month" tab:
   - ‚úÖ Should show October 2025
   - ‚úÖ Spending should be for October only (low amounts)
   - ‚úÖ Days left should be ~30
   - ‚úÖ Progress bars should reflect October spending
3. Check "Previous Month" tab:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Still shows placeholder (feature not yet implemented)
4. Test auto-reset (after Nov 1st):
   - Budgets should automatically reset
   - October data should move to history

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Optional: Implement Previous Month Tab
To show September data in the "Previous Month" tab, we need to:
1. Fetch budget_periods with `status = 'completed'`
2. Filter for most recent completed period
3. Display in similar card format

### Optional: Implement All Budgets Tab
To show complete history:
1. Fetch all budget_periods ordered by period_start DESC
2. Group by budget name
3. Show trend charts

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur after deployment:
```bash
# Revert the commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy the reverted code
# Database changes are backwards compatible (new columns have defaults)
```

## Expected Results After Deployment

### Current Month Tab (October 2025):
- Cristiano allowance: $0-50 spent of $1,200 (~0-4%)
- Vanguard: $0-100 spent of $1,000 (~0-10%)
- Camila allowance: $0-50 spent of $500 (~0-10%)
- Monthly Rent: $0 spent of $2,000 (0%)
- Monthly Groceries: $0-50 spent of $600 (~0-8%)

### Previous Month Tab:
- Currently shows placeholder
- Future enhancement: Show September 2025 completed data
