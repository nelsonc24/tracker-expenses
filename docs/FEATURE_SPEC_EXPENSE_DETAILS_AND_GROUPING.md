# Enhanced Expense Details and Activity Tracking Feature Specification

## Document Information
- **Feature**: Enhanced Expense Details and Activity Tracking System
- **Date**: September 9, 2025
- **Status**: Specification Draft
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Feature Enhancement

## 1. Overview and Objectives

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Currently, users can categorize transactions and add basic tags, but lack comprehensive expense detailing capabilities including:
- **No activity-based expense tracking**: Can't easily track total spending on specific activities (e.g., "How much did I spend on my dance club this year?")
- Limited expense metadata and context
- No flexible grouping mechanisms beyond categories
- Missing receipt and document management
- No expense splitting for shared costs
- Limited project or goal-based expense tracking
- No advanced tagging system with hierarchical organization

**Key Use Case Example**: A user wants to track all expenses related to their dance club membership - including monthly fees, special workshops, costumes, shoes, competition entries, and travel to events - to understand their total annual investment in this activity.

### 1.2 Objectives
- **Primary**: Provide activity-based expense tracking to answer questions like "How much do I spend on [activity] per year?"
- Provide comprehensive expense detailing capabilities
- Implement flexible grouping and tagging systems
- Enable receipt and document attachment
- Support expense splitting for shared costs
- Add project/goal-based expense tracking
- Create advanced analytics based on detailed expense data

### 1.3 Success Metrics
- 80% of users add detailed information to their transactions within first week
- 60% of users utilize grouping features for expense organization
- 50% increase in user engagement with expense tracking features
- Improved spending insights accuracy by 40%

## 2. Current State Analysis

### 2.1 Existing Capabilities
Based on the current schema and codebase:
- Basic transaction categorization with hierarchical categories
- Simple tagging system (array of strings in transactions.tags)
- Notes field for additional context
- Merchant and reference information
- Location data support (latitude/longitude/address)
- Bill linking and recurring transaction support

### 2.2 Limitations
- Tags are simple strings without organization or hierarchy
- No receipt or document storage
- No expense splitting capabilities
- Limited metadata for expense context
- No project or goal-based grouping
- No advanced search and filtering by detailed attributes

## 3. Feature Specifications
