# Zero Amount Transaction Import Fix

**Date:** October 15, 2025

## Summary
Implemented a filter to prevent importing transactions with zero amounts during CSV import.

## Problem
The CSV import functionality was allowing transactions with zero amounts to be imported into the database, which can clutter the transaction list with non-meaningful entries.

## Solution
Modified the transaction import logic in `/src/app/api/transactions/import/route.ts` to:

1. **Check for zero amounts** before processing each transaction
2. **Skip transactions** with zero amounts 
3. **Add them to the skipped list** with a clear reason ("Transaction has zero amount")
4. **Include them in the import summary** so users know they were skipped

## Implementation Details

### File Changed
- `/src/app/api/transactions/import/route.ts`

### Changes Made
In the transaction processing loop (around line 87-96), added:

```typescript
// Skip transactions with zero amount
const amount = parseFloat(tx.amount.toString())
if (amount === 0) {
  duplicateTransactions.push({
    ...tx,
    reason: 'Transaction has zero amount'
  })
  continue
}
```

### Benefits
1. **Cleaner data**: Prevents zero-amount transactions from cluttering the database
2. **User visibility**: Users are informed about skipped zero-amount transactions in the import summary
3. **Consistent handling**: Zero-amount transactions are treated similarly to duplicates (shown as skipped)
4. **No breaking changes**: Existing functionality remains intact

## User Experience
When importing a CSV file that contains transactions with zero amounts:
- These transactions will be **automatically skipped**
- The import summary will show: "Successfully imported X transactions, skipped Y duplicates"
- The skipped count includes both duplicates AND zero-amount transactions
- Users can see the skipped transactions with their reasons in the import results

## Testing Recommendations
To test this feature:
1. Create a CSV file with a mix of normal transactions and zero-amount transactions
2. Import the file through the Upload page
3. Verify that:
   - Zero-amount transactions are skipped
   - They appear in the skipped transactions list with reason "Transaction has zero amount"
   - Normal transactions are imported successfully
   - The import summary shows correct counts

## Example CSV for Testing
```csv
Date,Description,Amount,Category,Account
2025-10-15,Grocery Store,-50.00,Food,Checking
2025-10-15,Balance Inquiry,0.00,Other,Checking
2025-10-14,Gas Station,-35.75,Transport,Checking
2025-10-14,ATM Balance Check,0.00,Other,Checking
2025-10-13,Restaurant,-25.50,Food,Checking
```

Expected result:
- 3 transactions imported (Grocery Store, Gas Station, Restaurant)
- 2 transactions skipped (both balance checks with 0.00 amount)

## Notes
- This change is backward compatible
- No database schema changes required
- No changes to the frontend needed
- The fix automatically applies to all import sources (all bank CSV formats)
