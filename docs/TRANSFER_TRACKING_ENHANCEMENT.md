# Transfer Tracking Enhancement - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Issue:** Transfers between accounts/banks were being counted as income and expenses, causing inaccurate balance calculations

## Problem

When importing transactions from multiple accounts across different banks, transfers appear as:
- **Expense** in the source account (e.g., "Transfer To Ubank Bills Account")
- **Income** in the destination account (e.g., "Fast Transfer From...")

This double-counting causes:
- Inflated income figures
- Inflated expense figures
- Inaccurate net balance calculations
- Misleading budget and spending analytics

## Solution

Implemented automatic transfer detection and exclusion system that:
1. **Detects** transfers during CSV import using pattern matching
2. **Marks** them with an `isTransfer` flag in the database
3. **Excludes** them from income/expense calculations
4. **Shows** visual indicators in the UI

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Transfer Detection Logic

**File:** `src/lib/csv-processing.ts`

Added `isTransferTransaction()` function that detects common transfer patterns:

```typescript
export function isTransferTransaction(description: string): boolean {
  const desc = description.toLowerCase()
  
  const transferPatterns = [
    /transfer to .* account/i,           // "Transfer To Ubank Bills Account"
    /transfer from .* account/i,         // "Transfer From Savings Account"
    /fast transfer (to|from)/i,          // "Fast Transfer From PERSON"
    /payid (payment|transfer)/i,         // "PayID Payment"
    /osko payment/i,                     // "Osko Payment"
    /bpay transfer/i,                    // "BPAY Transfer"
    /internal transfer/i,                // "Internal Transfer"
    /account transfer/i,                 // "Account Transfer"
    /transfer - .* to .*/i,              // "Transfer - Account A to Account B"
    /own account transfer/i,             // "Own Account Transfer"
  ]
  
  return transferPatterns.some(pattern => pattern.test(desc))
}
```

**Updated Interface:**
```typescript
export interface ProcessedTransaction {
  // ... existing fields ...
  isTransfer?: boolean    // Flag to indicate if this is a transfer between accounts
  // ... existing fields ...
}
```

### 2. Import API Updates

**File:** `src/app/api/transactions/import/route.ts`

**Updated Interface:**
```typescript
interface TransactionData {
  // ... existing fields ...
  isTransfer?: boolean    // Flag to indicate transfer between accounts
}
```

**Save Transfer Flag:**
```typescript
newTransactions.push({
  // ... existing fields ...
  isTransfer: tx.isTransfer || false, // Save the transfer flag from CSV processing
  // ... existing fields ...
})
```

### 3. Balance Calculation Updates

**File:** `src/lib/db-utils.ts`

#### getTransactionSummary Function

**Exclude transfers from income:**
```typescript
const incomeResult = await db
  .select({ totalIncome: sum(transactions.amount) })
  .from(transactions)
  .where(and(
    ...conditions, 
    gte(transactions.amount, '0'), 
    eq(transactions.isTransfer, false)  // ✅ Exclude transfers
  ))
```

**Exclude transfers from expenses:**
```typescript
const expenseResult = await db
  .select({ totalExpenses: sum(transactions.amount) })
  .from(transactions)
  .where(and(
    ...conditions, 
    lte(transactions.amount, '0'),
    eq(transactions.isTransfer, false)  // ✅ Exclude transfers
  ))
```

#### getCategorySpending Function

**Exclude transfers from category spending:**
```typescript
const conditions = [
  eq(transactions.userId, userId),
  eq(transactions.isTransfer, false)  // ✅ Exclude transfers from category spending
]
```

This ensures:
- Dashboard cards show accurate income/expense totals
- Budget progress calculations exclude transfers
- Category spending analytics don't include transfers
- Spending trends reflect actual spending, not account movements

### 4. UI Visual Indicators

#### Desktop Table View
**File:** `src/app/(dashboard)/transactions/client.tsx`

```tsx
{transaction.isTransfer && transaction.amount > 0 && (
  <Tooltip>
    <TooltipTrigger asChild>
      <Badge variant="outline" className="text-xs px-1 py-0 h-4 bg-blue-50 text-blue-600 border-blue-200">
        Transfer
      </Badge>
    </TooltipTrigger>
    <TooltipContent>
      <p>Transfer from another account (excluded from income)</p>
    </TooltipContent>
  </Tooltip>
)}
```

#### Mobile Card View
**File:** `src/components/improved-mobile-transaction-card.tsx`

```tsx
{transaction.isTransfer && transaction.amount > 0 && (
  <Badge variant="outline" className="text-xs bg-blue-50 text-blue-600 border-blue-200">
    Transfer
  </Badge>
)}
```

#### Import Review Page
**File:** `src/app/(dashboard)/import/page.tsx`

```tsx
{transaction.isTransfer && (
  <Badge variant="outline" className="bg-blue-50 text-blue-600 border-blue-200">
    Transfer
  </Badge>
)}
```

## Testing Your Data

Using your provided CSV (`From 31-jul-CSVData.csv`):

### Sample Transaction Analysis

**Before Enhancement:**
- Total Income: Included all "Fast Transfer From" + Salary
- Total Expenses: Included all "Transfer To" + real expenses
- Result: Both inflated, inaccurate net balance

**After Enhancement:**
- Total Income: Only "Salary CardioNexus Remo" transactions
- Total Expenses: Only real expenses (Woolworths, ALDI, etc.)
- Transfers: Automatically marked and excluded
- Result: Accurate financial picture

### Example from Your Data (14/10/2025):
```csv
14/10/2025,"-4500.00","Transfer To Ubank Bills Account CommBank App Salary oct"  → Marked as Transfer ✓
14/10/2025,"-500.00","Transfer To RAUL CHANGO BAZALAR PayID Phone..."          → Marked as Transfer ✓
14/10/2025,"-200.00","Transfer To P CHAN PayID Phone..."                       → Marked as Transfer ✓
14/10/2025,"-1500.00","Transfer To P CHAN PayID Phone Cristiano..."           → Marked as Transfer ✓
14/10/2025,"+8076.00","Salary CardioNexus Remo CardioNexus RM"                → Real Income ✓
```

**Calculation:**
- Old way: Income = 8076, Expenses = 6700, Net = 1376
- New way: Income = 8076, Expenses = 0 (that day), Net = 8076
- The transfers are just moving money between accounts, not spending!

## How to Use

### 1. Import Your CSV Files
1. Go to **Import** page
2. Select your account (e.g., "Commonwealth Bank - Spend")
3. Upload CSV file
4. Review transactions - transfers will show blue "Transfer" badge
5. Click "Import Transactions"

### 2. View Your Accurate Balance
- **Dashboard**: Shows accurate income/expenses (transfers excluded)
- **Transactions Page**: Transfers marked with blue badge
- **Analytics**: Spending trends exclude transfers
- **Budgets**: Progress calculated without transfers

### 3. Multi-Account Setup
For best results:
1. Create separate accounts in the system:
   - "Commonwealth Spend"
   - "UBank Bills"
   - etc.
2. Import each CSV to its respective account
3. Transfers will be automatically detected and linked

---

## Database Schema

The `isTransfer` field already exists in your schema:

```typescript
// From src/lib/db/schema.ts
export const transactions = pgTable('transactions', {
  // ... other fields ...
  isTransfer: boolean('is_transfer').default(false).notNull(),
  transferPairId: uuid('transfer_pair_id'),  // For future linking feature
  // ... other fields ...
})
```

**Future Enhancement:** The `transferPairId` field can be used to link related transfer transactions across accounts.

---

## Migration Notes

### No Database Migration Required
- The `isTransfer` column already exists in the database
- Existing transactions have `isTransfer = false` by default
- New imports will automatically set the flag

### Re-importing Existing Data
If you want to update existing transactions:
1. Delete old transactions (if needed)
2. Re-import your CSV files
3. Transfers will be automatically detected

## Support

If you notice any transactions incorrectly marked (or not marked) as transfers, the detection patterns can be easily adjusted in `src/lib/csv-processing.ts`.

Common patterns already covered:
- ✅ "Transfer To/From"
- ✅ "Fast Transfer"
- ✅ "PayID" payments between accounts
- ✅ "Osko" payments
- ✅ "BPAY Transfer"
