# Transfer Income Feature - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Feature:** Mark income transactions as transfers between accounts

## Overview

This feature allows users to mark income transactions as transfers from another account, which ensures more accurate balance calculations by preventing double-counting of money that's simply moved between accounts.

## Use Case

When money is transferred from one account to another (e.g., from savings to checking):
- The receiving account shows an income transaction (+$500)
- The sending account shows an expense transaction (-$500)

Without this feature, the +$500 would be counted as income in reports and analytics, inflating the total income figure. By marking it as a transfer, it's excluded from income calculations.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Changes

**File:** `src/db/schema.ts`
- Added `isTransfer` boolean field to the transactions table
- Default value: `false`
- Only applies to income (positive amount) transactions

**Migration:** `drizzle/0004_add_is_transfer.sql`
- Adds the `is_transfer` column with default false
- Creates an index for query performance
- Includes documentation comments

### 2. UI Changes

#### Edit Transaction Dialog
**File:** `src/app/(dashboard)/transactions/client.tsx`

- Added checkbox control to mark transactions as transfers
- Only visible for income transactions (amount > 0)
- Includes helpful description: "Mark this income as a transfer to exclude it from total income calculations"
- Located after the Receipt Number field in the edit dialog

#### Transaction List Display
**File:** `src/app/(dashboard)/transactions/client.tsx`

- Transfer transactions display a blue "Transfer" badge next to the amount
- Badge includes tooltip: "Transfer from another account (excluded from income)"
- Only shown for income transactions marked as transfers

#### View Transaction Details Dialog
**File:** `src/app/(dashboard)/transactions/client.tsx`

- Shows "Transfer from another account" badge
- Includes explanation that it's excluded from income calculations
- Only displayed for income transactions with `isTransfer = true`

### 3. API Changes

#### Transaction Update Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/transactions/[id]/route.ts`

- Updated schema to accept `isTransfer` field
- Stores the transfer flag in database

#### Transaction Create/List Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/transactions/route.ts`

- GET endpoint returns `isTransfer` field
- POST endpoint accepts and stores `isTransfer` field

#### Utility Functions
**File:** `src/lib/db-utils.ts`

- Updated `createTransaction` function to accept `isTransfer` parameter
- Updated `getTransactionSummary` to exclude transfers from income calculations

### 4. Balance Calculation Updates

#### Dashboard Summary
**File:** `src/lib/db-utils.ts` - `getTransactionSummary` function

Income query now filters out transfers:
```typescript
.where(and(...conditions, gte(transactions.amount, '0'), eq(transactions.isTransfer, false)))
```

#### Transaction Page Summary
**File:** `src/app/(dashboard)/transactions/client.tsx`

```typescript
const totalIncome = filteredTransactions
  .filter(t => t.amount > 0 && !t.isTransfer)
  .reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.amount, 0)
```

## User Workflow

1. **View Transactions:** Navigate to transactions page
2. **Edit Transaction:** Click on any income transaction and select "Edit"
3. **Mark as Transfer:** Check the "This is a transfer from another account" checkbox
4. **Save:** Click "Save Changes"
5. **Verification:** 
   - Transaction shows "Transfer" badge in the list
   - Income calculations on dashboard exclude this amount
   - Net balance remains accurate

## Impact on Reports

### What Changes:
- **Total Income:** Excludes transfers
- **Net Amount:** More accurate (income - expenses, without double-counting)
- **Dashboard Cards:** Shows accurate income/expense breakdown

### What Doesn't Change:
- **Total Expenses:** Unchanged
- **Transaction Count:** All transactions still counted
- **Account Balances:** Individual account balances remain accurate

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Schema updated with `isTransfer` field
- [x] Migration file created
- [x] Edit dialog shows checkbox for income transactions
- [x] Checkbox only appears for positive amounts
- [x] API endpoints accept and store `isTransfer` field
- [x] Transfer badge displays in transaction list
- [x] View details dialog shows transfer status
- [x] Income calculations exclude transfers
- [x] Dashboard totals reflect accurate income
- [x] Transaction page summary excludes transfers from income

## Deployment Notes

1. **Migration Required:** Run database migration to add `is_transfer` column
2. **Backward Compatible:** Existing transactions default to `isTransfer = false`
3. **No Data Migration Needed:** Users can manually mark existing transfers

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future releases:

1. **Auto-detect Transfers:** Automatically detect transfers by matching amounts and dates between accounts
2. **Link Transfer Pairs:** Create explicit relationships between transfer transactions
3. **Transfer Transaction Type:** Add a dedicated "transfer" transaction type
4. **Bulk Transfer Marking:** Allow marking multiple transactions as transfers at once
5. **Transfer Reports:** Dedicated view for inter-account transfers

## Files Changed

1. `src/db/schema.ts` - Added `isTransfer` field
2. `drizzle/0004_add_is_transfer.sql` - Migration file
3. `src/app/(dashboard)/transactions/client.tsx` - UI updates
4. `src/app/(dashboard)/transactions/page.tsx` - Type definitions
5. `src/app/api/transactions/[id]/route.ts` - Update endpoint
6. `src/app/api/transactions/route.ts` - Create/list endpoints
7. `src/lib/db-utils.ts` - Balance calculations

## Summary

This feature provides users with fine-grained control over how income is calculated, ensuring that inter-account transfers don't artificially inflate income totals. The implementation is non-breaking, backward compatible, and provides clear visual indicators throughout the UI.
