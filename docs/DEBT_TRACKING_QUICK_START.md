# Quick Start: Debt Tracking Feature

## ðŸš€ Getting Started (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

Make sure you have your `DATABASE_URL` configured in your `.env.local` or `.env.prod` file, then run:

```bash
# For local development
pnpm drizzle-kit push

# Or if you need to specify environment
pnpm drizzle-kit push --config=drizzle.config.ts
```

This will create 5 new tables:
- `debts`
- `debt_payments`
- `debt_strategies`
- `debt_projections`
- `debt_milestones`

### Step 2: Start the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Step 3: Navigate to Debts

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000/debts
```

Or click on "Debts" in the sidebar navigation.

### Step 4: Add Your First Debt

1. Click the **"Add Debt"** button
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Debt Name:** "My Credit Card"

   - **Interest Rate:** 19.99
   - **Min Payment:** 150.00
   - **Frequency:** Monthly
