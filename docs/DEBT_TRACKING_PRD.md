# Debt Tracking & Payoff Projection – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last updated:** 3 October 2025  
**Status:** Draft for Review

---

## 1) Overview and Vision

Build a comprehensive debt management system within the expense tracker that allows users to track all their debts (credit cards, loans, mortgages, personal debts) in one place, visualize total debt burden, and create actionable payoff strategies with projections.

### Primary Goals
- Provide a centralized view of all debts with real-time balance tracking
- Calculate total debt burden across all debt types
- Generate intelligent payoff projections with multiple strategy options (snowball, avalanche, custom)
- Visualize debt-free timelines and interest savings
- Track payment history and progress toward debt reduction goals
- Alert users to upcoming payments and interest rate changes

### Non-Goals (Initially)
- Direct payment processing or bill pay functionality
- Credit score monitoring and reporting
- Debt consolidation loan recommendations
- Refinancing calculators (may be added in Phase 2)
- Third-party debt negotiation services

---

## 2) Target Users and Jobs-To-Be-Done

### Personas
- **Debt-conscious individuals:** People actively working to pay down credit card debt, student loans, or personal loans
- **Homeowners:** Tracking mortgage and home equity line of credit (HELOC) balances
- **Financial planners:** Users who want a complete picture of net worth including liabilities
- **Couples:** Partners managing shared debts and coordinating payoff strategies

### JTBD
- "Show me how much total debt I have across all accounts"
- "Help me create a realistic plan to become debt-free"
- "Calculate how much interest I'll save with different payoff strategies"
- "Alert me when debt payments are due"
- "Track my progress toward becoming debt-free"
- "Compare paying off debts vs investing extra cash"
- "Visualize what my finances would look like with one debt paid off"

## 6) UI/UX Design Principles

### Visual Design
- **Debt is Red, Progress is Green:** Use color psychology
  - High debt/high interest: Red/orange gradient
  - Low debt/low interest: Yellow/green gradient
  - Paid off: Green with celebration effect
- **Progress Bars Everywhere:** Visual feedback on payoff progress
- **Trend Indicators:** Up/down arrows for balance changes
- **Milestone Celebrations:** Confetti, badges, achievement unlocks

### Information Hierarchy
1. **At-a-glance metrics** (top cards): Total debt, monthly payment, debt-free date
2. **Actionable items** (middle section): Upcoming payments, optimization suggestions
3. **Detailed analysis** (lower/tabs): Charts, tables, projections, history

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-first** approach for payment logging (most common action)
- **Desktop optimization** for strategy comparison and detailed analysis
- **Touch-friendly** controls for reordering debt priorities
- **Swipe gestures** for quick payment logging on mobile

### Accessibility
- **High contrast** for debt amounts and warnings
- **Screen reader support** for all interactive elements
- **Keyboard navigation** for forms and tables
- **ARIA labels** for charts and visualizations
- **Alternative text** for iconography

### Micro-interactions
- **Smooth animations** for balance updates (count-up/count-down)
- **Pulse effect** for overdue payments
- **Confetti** for debt payoffs
- **Progress bar fills** with satisfying animation
- **Haptic feedback** on mobile for payment confirmations

## 7) Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Architecture

**Frontend (Next.js 14+ with App Router)**
- `/app/(dashboard)/debts/` - Debt management pages
  - `page.tsx` - Main debt dashboard
  - `[id]/page.tsx` - Individual debt details
  - `strategies/page.tsx` - Strategy creation/comparison
  - `projections/page.tsx` - Visual projections and charts
  - `reports/page.tsx` - Reports and exports

**Components**
- `DebtSummaryCard.tsx` - Overview metrics
- `DebtTable.tsx` - Sortable debt list
- `DebtForm.tsx` - Add/edit debt modal
- `PaymentForm.tsx` - Quick/detailed payment logging
- `StrategyBuilder.tsx` - Multi-step strategy wizard
- `PayoffProjection.tsx` - Chart components for projections
- `DebtCalendar.tsx` - Payment due date calendar
- `MilestoneTracker.tsx` - Achievement display

**API Routes**
- `/api/debts` - CRUD operations for debts
- `/api/debts/[id]/payments` - Payment logging and history
- `/api/debts/strategies` - Strategy CRUD
- `/api/debts/projections` - Calculate projections
- `/api/debts/reports` - Generate reports
- `/api/debts/milestones` - Track milestones

### 7.2 Calculation Engine

**Projection Algorithm (Simplified)**
```typescript
function calculatePayoffProjection(
  debts: Debt[],
  strategy: DebtStrategy,
  extraPayment: number
): DebtProjection[] {
  const projections: DebtProjection[] = []
  let currentMonth = 0
  let remainingDebts = [...debts]
  
  while (remainingDebts.some(d => d.balance > 0)) {
    // Sort debts by strategy priority
    const sortedDebts = sortByStrategy(remainingDebts, strategy.type)
    
    // Calculate minimum payments for all debts
    const totalMinimumPayment = sortedDebts.reduce(
      (sum, d) => sum + d.minimumPayment, 0
    )
    
    // Allocate extra payment to highest priority debt
    const targetDebt = sortedDebts.find(d => d.balance > 0)
    if (!targetDebt) break
    
    // Calculate interest accrued this month
    for (const debt of remainingDebts) {
      const monthlyRate = debt.interestRate / 12 / 100
      const interestAccrued = debt.balance * monthlyRate
      debt.balance += interestAccrued
      
      // Apply payment
      const payment = debt === targetDebt 
        ? debt.minimumPayment + extraPayment
        : debt.minimumPayment
      
      const principalPaid = payment - interestAccrued
      debt.balance -= principalPaid
      
      // Record projection
      projections.push({
        debtId: debt.id,
        month: currentMonth,
        balance: Math.max(debt.balance, 0),
        payment: payment,
        principal: principalPaid,
        interest: interestAccrued
      })
      
      // Remove paid off debts
      if (debt.balance <= 0) {
        debt.balance = 0
        // Roll payment to next debt (snowball effect)
      }
    }
    
    currentMonth++
    
    // Safety: max 600 months (50 years)
    if (currentMonth > 600) break
  }
  
  return projections
}
```

**Interest Calculation Methods**
- **Simple Interest:** `I = P × r × t`
- **Compound Interest (Monthly):** `A = P(1 + r/12)^(12t)`
- **Daily Compound:** `A = P(1 + r/365)^(365t)`

### 7.3 Data Privacy & Security

**Encryption**
- **At-rest encryption** for sensitive fields (account numbers)
- Use `pgcrypto` extension for PostgreSQL
- Encrypt before storing, decrypt on read
- Store only last 4 digits visible to user

**Access Control**
- All debt data scoped to `userId`
- Row-level security (RLS) in Supabase/Postgres
- API routes verify user authentication (Clerk)
- No cross-user data access

**Audit Logging**
- Log all balance updates and payment entries
- Retain audit trail for data reconciliation
- Track who/when for shared accounts (future)

### 7.4 Performance Optimization

**Caching Strategy**
- Cache projection calculations for 24 hours
- Invalidate cache on debt/payment updates
- Use Redis or in-memory cache for active strategies
- Pre-calculate common scenarios (standard extra payment amounts)

**Database Optimization**
- Indexes on frequently queried columns (userId, status, nextDueDate)
- Materialized views for complex aggregations
- Batch updates for payment logging
- Efficient pagination for payment history

**Frontend Performance**
- Lazy load chart libraries (Recharts, Chart.js)
- Server-side render initial dashboard data
- Client-side cache for debt list
- Optimistic UI updates for payment logging
- Debounce slider inputs for real-time projections

### 7.5 Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**
- Projection calculation accuracy
- Interest calculation methods
- Strategy sorting algorithms
- Date/time calculations for due dates

**Integration Tests**
- API route handlers (CRUD operations)
- Database queries and transactions
- Payment logging workflow
- Strategy creation and activation

**E2E Tests (Playwright)**
- Complete debt creation flow
- Payment logging and balance update
- Strategy wizard completion
- Report generation and export

**Test Scenarios**
- Edge case: Debt with 0% interest
- Edge case: Extra payment larger than balance
- Edge case: Variable interest rate changes
- Edge case: Payment before due date
- Load test: 100+ debts, 1000+ payments
