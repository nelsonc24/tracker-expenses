# Security Audit - Test Scripts

## ✅ All Scripts Are Safe to Commit

All test scripts have been audited and **no sensitive information** is exposed. All credentials are loaded from environment variables (`.env.local`) which is already in `.gitignore`.

### Scripts Checked:

1. **test-resend.ts** ✅
   - Loads `RESEND_API_KEY` from environment
   - Loads `EMAIL_FROM` from environment
   - No hardcoded credentials

2. **test-email-direct.ts** ✅
   - Loads `RESEND_API_KEY` from environment
   - Loads `EMAIL_FROM` from environment
   - No hardcoded credentials

3. **test-notification-system.ts** ✅
   - Loads `DATABASE_URL` from environment
   - No hardcoded credentials

4. **debug-resend-api.ts** ✅
   - Loads `RESEND_API_KEY` from environment
   - Loads `EMAIL_FROM` from environment
   - No hardcoded credentials

5. **apply-notifications-migration.ts** ✅
   - Loads `DATABASE_URL` from environment
   - No hardcoded credentials

6. **apply-notifications-migration-prod.ts** ✅
   - **FIXED**: Now loads `PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL` from environment
   - Previously had hardcoded production database URL (now removed)
   - No hardcoded credentials

## Best Practices Followed:

- ✅ All sensitive data loaded from environment variables
- ✅ `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ No API keys, passwords, or connection strings in code
- ✅ Scripts only show masked/partial credentials in output
- ✅ Safe to commit to public or private repositories

## What's NOT Safe to Commit:

- ❌ `.env.local` - Contains actual API keys and database credentials
- ❌ `.env` - Contains environment-specific secrets
- ✅ `.env.example` - Safe to commit (contains placeholder values only)

## Verified Safe to Commit:

You can safely commit all these scripts to Git:

```bash
git add scripts/test-*.ts
git add scripts/debug-*.ts
git add scripts/apply-*.ts
git commit -m "Add notification system test scripts"
```
